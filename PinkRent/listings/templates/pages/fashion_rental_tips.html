    <h2>{% trans "Item Fit Concerns" %}</h2>

    <h2>{% trans "Clarify Additional Costs" %}</h2>
    <p>{% trans "Ask if there are any extra costs included in the rental period, such as shipping and cleaning. Make sure all costs are transparent before finalizing the rental." %}</p>

    <h2>{% trans "Handle the Item with Care" %}</h2>

    <h2>{% trans "Discuss Wear and Tear" %}</h2>
    <p>{% trans "Before the rental period, discuss potential outcomes for wear and tear situations with the lender to avoid misunderstandings." %}</p>

    <h2>{% trans "Reviews" %}</h2>
    <p>{% trans "When leaving a review, whether for the lender or the rented item, aim to provide valuable insights. For the lender, highlight their reliability, communication, and the overall borrowing experience. Similarly, when reviewing the rented item, include a picture of yourself wearing it to help others visualize and mention any size discrepancies or styling tips. Your detailed reviews contribute to a safer and more informed community on our platform." %}</p>
